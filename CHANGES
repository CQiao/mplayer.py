Changes since 0.4.0


---------
 General
---------

* Added basic PyGTK and PyQt widgets for embedding MPlayer
* Renamed module/package from 'pymplayer' to 'mplayer'
* Moved asyncore integration code into a separate class (AsyncMPlayer)
* Removed Client-Server stuff
* asyncore.loop() no longer imported by default (i.e., imported for convenience)
* Windows support
* Python 3 compatibility
* Explicit TypeErrors/ValueErrors replaced with asserts
* Use threading.Lock() for MPlayer.query and _FileWrapper.readline methods (thread-safe?)

----------
 Behavior
----------
MPlayer
 - _check_command_args() no longer checks for argument types (less strict and more flexible)
 - added '-input nodefault-bindings -noconfig all' to default args
 - Aside from iterables, the 'args' property now accepts strings (command line)
 - query(): return None if value is equal to '(null)'

-----
 API
-----
MPlayer

Additions:

def get_property(self, name, timeout=0.25):

Changes:
* 'executable' class property has been renamed to 'path'


Deletions:


----------
_FileWrapper (used in MPlayer.stdout/stderr)


 - 'publish' method renamed to '__call__' ()
 - attach/detach methods renamed to hook/unhook respectively


There are now three ways of obtaining data from MPlayer.

1. via readline() method:

m = mplayer.MPlayer()
m.start(stdout=mplayer.PIPE)
line = m.stdout.readline()

This method simply returns whatever is in the pipe buffers.
Although this is convenient, using this method is not recommended because
the MPlayer process may still hang if the pipe buffers get filled up and
just sit there waiting to be read from. If you want to, you can define a
timer for periodically calling readline() just to clear up the buffers.
You can also use this with #3.


2. via query() method:

m = mplayer.MPlayer()
m.start(stdout=mplayer.PIPE)
m.command('loadfile', '/path/to/some/file.mkv')
time_length = m.query('get_time_length')
# if successful, time_length should now contain a float object

Using only this method has the same problems as the readline() method above.
I personally use this method with the one described below (#3) since I won't
have to worry about MPlayer hanging.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Upon execution, query() will temporarily suppress the transfer of data to the
subscribers. Upon finishing, data transfer to the subscribers will be enabled
again.


3. via subscribers (asynchronous):

This method is inspired by the Observer design pattern (aka publisher/subscriber)
and is the replacement for handle_data() and handle_error() introduced in 0.3.0.
Basically, subscribers are simply callback functions which accept a single
parameter--the data published by whichever publisher (stdout/stderr) the
subscribers are attached to.


Example for typical usage of methods:

"a hypothetical class for a GUI program"

...
def __init__(self):
  super(SomeClass, self).__init__()
  self.pl = playlist_generator()
  self.m = mplayer.MPlayer()
  # introspect MPlayer executable so that we can just use additional methods
  # instead of using command() or query() directly
  self.m.introspect()
  self.m.stdout.hook(self.check_mplayer_eof)
  self.timer = SomeTimer(timeout=1000, callback=self.update_status)

def __del__(self):
  # not really needed. just here for demo purposes
  self.m.stdout.unhook(self.check_mplayer_eof)
  # make sure MPlayer is terminated properly
  self.m.quit()

def load_video(self):
  video = self.pl.next() # get next video
  self.m.loadfile(video) # uses command() internally
  filename = self.m.get_file_name() # uses query() internally
  time_length = self.m.get_time_length() # uses query() internally
  self.statusbar.set_text('Now playing: %s (%d seconds)' % (filename, time_length))

def check_mplayer_eof(self, data):
  if data.startswith('EOF code'):
    self.load_video()

def update_status(self):
  pos = self.m.get_time_pos()
  self.statusbar2.set_text('Current Time: %d' % (pos, ))

def run(self):
  # subscribers were attached to stdout, no need to explicitly set stdout to PIPE
  self.m.start()
  # echo first 5 lines of MPlayer's output
  for i in xrange(5):
    print 'debug: ', self.m.stdout.readline()
...
