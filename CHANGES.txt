PyMPlayer 0.7.0

Changes since 0.6.0

--------------------
      General
--------------------

 * Added type checking to generated methods and properties (including Step)
 * Added value checking to generated properties
 * Properties now use functools.partial objects (more memory efficient)
 * Abstracted MPlayer type handling away from the core (see mtypes module)


--------------------
        API
--------------------

Changes:
 * Player.path has been renamed to Player.exec_path

 * The 'path' property is no longer renamed to 'filepath'. Player.path now
   pertains to the 'path' property of MPlayer (i.e. Player.filepath in 0.6.0).

 * Removed optional 'prefix' parameter from generated methods. That is,
   for instance, pause(prefix=None) -> pause().

 * The default parameters of generated methods is now None instead of a blank
   string. That is, for instance:

      loadfile(self, str0, int1='') -> loadfile(self, str0, int1=None)


Deletions:
 * Player.get_meta_*():
   Removed all get_meta_* methods. Use the 'metadata' property instead.
